                    <p>My passion lies in Microsoft Teams - I'm all about making collaboration and communication easy and seamless for everyone.

                    </br>
                    <p>One of my specialties is Tenant to Tenant migrations. I take pride in ensuring that the transition is as seamless as possible, with no or minimal disruptions to the business. And when I roll out projects - big or small - I'm all about making sure that the end-users can collaborate from wherever they are.</p>

                                    <p>Durham, England, United Kingdom</p>
                                    <p>Providing 3rd line technical support to all my colleagues covering the following areas: Servicedesk, NOC, SOC, Backups, Problems and Projects.</p>
                                    <ul>Statement 3rd line support includes:
                                        <li>Recovering from a Cyber incident that impacted 250+ servers. Duties included threat hunting, firewall hardening, disaster recovery, patching and isolating critical VMs.</li>
                                        <li>Recovering from an Internet line cut off. One client were due to migrate internet lines as part of a project, the old and new were working side by side. The old line got cut off earlier than anticapted and the project lead was on holiday. Nothing had been configured on the firewall and switches for the new internet line. Routes, access control lists, interfaces and VLANs all needed to be setup to bring service back ASAP.</li>
                                        <li>Helping Cisco find a bug in their firewall firmware (ASA). One client had a pair of firewalls in HA and they'd randomly stop processing traffic. The workaround was to restart the firewalls, however given the client was over 300 miles away, we had to implement a 4G router alternative for access to the equipment. Long hours were spent with Cisco SmartNet support and we found a memory leak in the latest firmware version, specific to our configuration.</li>

                    <h3>My Passion</h3>
                    <h4>Web design and development</h4>
                    <p>Who do you think made this website? You guessed right - <span onmouseover="MakeMeHighlighted()" onmouseleave="MakeMeUnhighlighted()">this guy.</span></p>
                    <p>Over the years I've had a passion for developing and designing websites. I follow the philosophy of, if you make someone think when they are on a website of where to look, click or go browse to find something - they've already closed the website and moved on. Web design should be simple, with an ease of flow - anything more than two clicks away than you've likely already lost the customer. I've designed multiple websites, including for a golf club and a roofer.</p>
                    <h4>Sharing knowledge</h4>
                    <p>Knowledge sharing has always been a passion of mine. I’ve gained knowledge from other people who’ve been willing to share theirs, so why not give back? I’m currently in the process of creating a Technical Documentation website. The idea of this website is to share all my knowledge that I’ve gained of my time in the Technology industry to absolutely anyone. This can be anything from Networking, Telephony to SSL certificates. I’m also in the process of creating blueprints that people can follow when rolling out projects.</p>
